# ANM_MC_Load_Poses_On_Selected_Frames
 A Toon Boom Harmony shelf script. On each selected frame, this script reads the Master Controller's current position and then load the pose that corresponds to the position. You can load poses from Master Controller rigs created with Interporation Grid and Slider Wizards.
